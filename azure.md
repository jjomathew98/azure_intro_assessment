STORAGE:

Azure Blob Storage:
Service Description: Azure Blob Storage is a scalable object storage service that allows us to store and manage unstructured data like documents, photos, videos, and backups. It is highly available and long-lasting, and it may be utilized for a variety of applications such as data preservation, content distribution, and data lakes.
Python Interaction: We can connect with Azure Blob Storage using the Azure SDK for Python (azure-storage-blob). This SDK includes Python classes and methods for uploading, downloading, deleting, and managing blobs in your storage account.

Azure File Storage: 
Service Description: Azure File Storage is a fully managed file-sharing service available via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. It is appropriate for file sharing and storing application data on the cloud. It works with both Windows and Linux clients.
Python Interaction: We may connect with Azure File Storage using the Azure SDK for Python (azure-storage-file-share). This SDK allows We to programmatically build, manage, and access file shares, folders, and files from your Python applications.

COMPUTE:

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs):
Service Description: Azure Virtual machines (VM) are scalable and customized virtual computers that operate on the Azure infrastructure. We may run your apps, host websites, or conduct other computing operations on a range of VM sizes and images, including Windows and Linux.
Python Interaction: We can manage Azure Virtual Machines with the Azure SDK for Python (azure-mgmt-compute). This SDK allows We to build, start, stop, resize, and delete virtual machines programmatically. We may also automate VM provisioning and configuration chores.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):
Service Description: Azure Kubernetes Service is a managed container orchestration service that facilitates the deployment, maintenance, and scalability of containerized applications using Kubernetes. It includes capabilities such as auto-scaling, monitoring, and connection with Azure services.
Python Interaction: We can communicate with Azure AKS using the Azure SDK for Python. With this SDK, We can establish and manage AKS clusters, deploy containerized apps, and expand your clusters as needed. We may also control workloads within AKS clusters using the Kubernetes Python client.

DATABASE SERVICES:

Azure SQL Database:
Service Description: Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service based on Microsoft SQL Server. It provides excellent availability, security, and scalability for hosting databases. It is appropriate for a wide range of applications, from small-scale to mission-critical.
Python Interaction: The Python library may be used to establish database connections, execute SQL queries, and conduct data operations using Azure SQL Database. We may also use the Azure SDK for Python to manage and provision Azure SQL Database resources programmatically.

Azure Cosmos DB:
Service Description: Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service designed for high availability and low latency data access. It supports a variety of data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column family, making it suited for a wide range of applications.
Python Interaction: We can use the Azure Cosmos DB Python SDK to interface with Azure Cosmos DB. This SDK enables us to conduct CRUD activities, query data, and manage database resources dynamically from your Python applications.
